# pystata-kernel

A simple Jupyter kernel for Stata based on [pystata](https://www.stata.com/python/pystata/). 
Requires Stata 17 or above.
Consider [stata_kernel](https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel) instead if you have an 
older version of Stata. 

**Note: Starting with version 0.3.0, `pystata-kernel` will be updated once every six months. 
If new features and timely updates are important to you, 
please consider using [`nbstata`](https://github.com/hugetim/nbstata),
which is further along in development.**

### Installation
To install `pystata-kernel`:

```python
pip install pystata-kernel
python -m pystata-kernel.install [--sys-prefix] [--prefix] [--conf-file]
```

Include `--sys-prefix` if you are installing `pystata-kernel` in a multi-user environment,
or `--prefix` if you want to specify a path yourself.

The kernel will try to determine the location of your Stata installation at startup. 
You can create a configuration file to preempt this detection with the `--conf-file` option.
Even if you do not include this option, the configuration file will still be created if the 
installer cannot find any Stata installation.

The location of the configuration file is:

- `[prefix]/etc/pystata-kernel.conf` if `--sys-prefix` is specified.
-  `~/.pystata-kernel.conf` otherwise.

If a configuration file exists in both locations, the user version takes precedent. 

Syntax highlighting is the same as `stata_kernel`:

```sh
conda install nodejs -c conda-forge --repodata-fn=repodata.json
jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-stata-highlight
```

### Configuration

The following settings are permitted inside the configuration file:

- `stata_dir`: Stata installation directory.
- `edition`: Stata edition. Acceptable values are 'be', 'se' and 'mp'.
    Default is 'be'.
- `graph_format`: Graph format. Acceptable values are 'png', 'pdf', 'svg' and 'pystata'.
    Specify the last option if you want to use `pystata`'s setting. Default is 'png'. 
- `echo`: controls the echo of commands:
    - 'True': the kernel will echo all commands. 
    - 'False': the kernel will not echo single commands.
    - 'None': the kernel will not echo any command. 

    Default is 'False'.
- `splash`: controls display of the splash message during Stata startup. Default is 'True'.
- `missing`: What should be displayed in the output of the `*%browse` magic for a missing value. Default is '.', following Stata. To defer to pandas' format for `NA`, specify 'pandas'.

Settings must be under the title `[pystata-kernel]`. Example:

```
[pystata-kernel]
stata_dir = /opt/stata
edition = mp
graph_format = svg
echo = True
splash = False
```

### Default Graph Format

Both `pystata` and `stata_kernel` default to the SVG image format. 
`pystata-kernel` defaults to the PNG image format instead for several reasons:

- Jupyter does not show SVG images from untrusted notebooks ([link 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68398033/svg-figures-hidden-in-jupyterlab-after-some-time)).
- Notebooks with empty cells are untrusted ([link 2](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/9765)).
- SVG images cannot be copied and pasted directly into Word or PowerPoint.

These issues make the SVG format unsuitable for use in a pedagogical setting, 
which is my primary use of a Jupyter kernel for Stata. 

### Magics

Magics are commands that only work in `pystata-kernel` and are not part of 
Stata's syntax. 
Magics normally start with `%`, but this will cause errors when the notebook
is exported and run as a Stata script. As an alternative, you can prefix the 
magic name with `*%`, which will simply be treated by Stata as a single-line comment.

`pystata-kernel` currently supports the following magics:

| Magic | Description | Full Syntax |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `*%browse` | View dataset | `*%browse [-h] [N] [varlist] [if] [in]` |
| `*%help` | Display a help file in rich text| `*%help [-h] command_or_topic_name` |
| `*%noecho` | Suppress echo in current cell | `*%noecho` |
| `*%quietly` | Suppress all output from current cell | `*%quietly` |
